* benchmark forked from datalevin
- extended to include datahike
- munged the core bench stuff to work on local windows setup
- benchmark code should be equivalent (just adapted for API nuances)

* Invocation
Designed to be run from clojure cli.  Assuming you have that installed
and the `clojure` or `clj` command available:

clj -m bench

Invokes a somewhat lengthy processing of all the libs and query benchmarks.
There should be support similar to the original for passing in specific
libs to test, right now all versions are "latest" and really only
resolve to what's in the deps.edn; so there's a difference in that
respect.


* Benchmarks 

Median run times in ms (per extant benchmarking infrastructure):
